## 🧩 UI Component Patterns

In this project, reusable and modular UI components will be created to build a consistent and maintainable interface across the application. These components follow modern frontend best practices and are designed for responsiveness and accessibility.

### 🔧 Planned Components

---

### 🧭 Navbar

- Displays the application logo, navigation links (Home, Listings, Bookings, Profile).
- Includes a responsive hamburger menu for mobile view.
- Contains a search input field (optional) and user account dropdown.

---

### 🏘️ Property Card

- Displays key property information in a clean, card-style format.
- Includes image, title, location, price, and a rating or favorite icon.
- Designed to be clickable and lead to the detailed property page.
- Responsive grid layout on desktop and mobile.

---

### 📜 Footer

- Contains important links such as About, Contact, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy.
- Displays company information and optional social media icons.
- Stays consistent across all pages and fits the color/design theme.

---

### ➕ Additional Components (planned)

- **Button:** Reusable primary and secondary styled buttons for actions like “Book Now” or “Submit”.
- **Booking Summary Card:** Displays selected dates, property price, and total cost during checkout.
- **Image Carousel:** Scrollable image gallery for detailed property views.
- **Search/Filter Bar:** Allows users to filter listings by location, price range, and property type.

---

These components will be developed with:
- **Component-based architecture** (React)
- **Mobile-first design principles**
- **Accessibility (WCAG) compliance**
- **Separation of logic and presentation**

By designing UI elements as reusable components, the development process becomes more efficient and the user experience remains consistent across the entire application.
